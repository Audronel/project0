                        <h3>Ollie</h3>
                        <p>
                            An Ollie is a jump where the front wheels leave the ground first. This motion is attained with a snap of the tail (from the backfoot) and sliding your front-foot forward to reach any altitude.

                        <h3>Grabs</h3>
                        <p>
                            A Grab involves floating in the air, while using either hand to hold the board against the feet or keeping constant and careful pressure on the board with the feet to keep it from floating away. Indy Grab usually combine rotation with different grabs.

                            Flip Tricks
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Flip tricks are a subset of aerials which are all based on the ollie. An example is the kickflip, the most widely known and performed flip trick. The board can be spun around many different axes as part of a flip trick, thus combining several rotations into one trick.

                        <p>
                            Freestyle skateboarding tricks are tricks specifically associated with freestyle skateboarding. And are part of the building blocks and some of the most important reference points for tricks which have evolved to form Street Skateboarding.

                            Slides and Grinds
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Slides and grinds involve getting the board up on some type of ledge, rail, or coping and sliding or grinding along the board or trucks, respectively. When it is primarily the board which is contacting the edge, it's called a slide; when it's the truck, it is a grind.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            A manual is a balancing trick where a skateboarder balances on either the front two or rear two wheels, without the other two wheels or any other part of the skateboard touching the ground for the entire duration of the trick.
